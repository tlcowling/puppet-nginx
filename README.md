=======

I've used variants of this personally for some time, but I figured it was finally time to give back to the community.  Currently I'm just working with the load_balancing capacity of nginx.

Example hiera config: ```hieradata/test.yaml``` 

Development
-----------

To dev on this you can change puppet code and then run

```make test```

todo:

healthchecks
rate limits? :)
